# mTRF-Toolbox
mTRF Toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox that permits the fast computation of the linear stimulus-response mapping of any sensory system in the forward or backward direction. It is suitable for analysing EEG, MEG, ECoG and EMG data.  The forward model, or temporal response function (TRF), can be interpreted using conventional analysis techniques such as time-frequency and source analysis. The TRF can also be used to predict future responses of the system given a new stimulus signal. Similarly, the backward model can be used to reconstruct spectrotemporal stimulus information given new response data.  mTRF Toolbox facilitates the use of continuous stimuli in electrophysiological studies as opposed to time-locked averaging techniques which require discrete stimuli. This enables examination of how neural systems process more natural and ecologically valid stimuli such as speech, music, motion and contrast.
